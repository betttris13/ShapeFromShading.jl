The Frankot-Chellappa method is a fast, reliable method for integration surface normals while enforcing integrability using Fourier methods.\n\nOutput\n\nFrankot() returns a Frankot integrator which can then be called to run the Frankot-Chellappa method on a gradient field.\n\nDetails\n\nFrankot-Chellappa method uses Fourier methods to attempt to solve the Poission equation nabla^2z = partial_up + partial_vq. By taking the Fourier transform of both sides we get:\n\n(omega^2_u + omega^2_v)hatz(omega_u omega_v) = imath omega_uhatp\n(omega_u omega_v) + imath omega_vhatq(omega_u omega_v)\n\nBy rearanging the above equation we arive at an equation for hatz;\n\nhatz(omega_u omega_v) = fracomega_uhatp(omega_u omega_v) +\nomega_vhatq(omega_u omega_v)imath(omega^2_u + omega^2_v)\n\nFrom which the final surface can be found by taking the inverse Fourier transform of hatz.\n\nDue to the way (omega_u omega_v) is defined the algorithm works best when the input dimentions are odd in length. To accomidate this the integrator will pad the edge of the inputs if they are even before running the algorithm. This padding will be removed before returning a value hence output size will be unaffected.\n\nParameters\n\nFrankot integrator take no parameters.\n\nExample\n\nThe following example demontraits the use of the Frankot integrator.\n\nusing ShapeFromShading, Makie\n\n# Generate synthetic gradients\np, q = synthetic_gradient(SynthSphere(), radius = 38, img_size = 151)\n\n# Create a Frankot() integrator\nfrankot = Frankot()\n\n# Calculate the heightmap from the gradients\nZ = frankot(p, q)\n\n# Normalize to maximum of 1 (not necessary but makes displaying easier)\nZ = Z./maximum(Z)\n\n# Display using Makie (Note: Makie can often take several minutes first time)\nr = 0.0:0.1:4\nsurface(r, r, Z)\n\nReference\n\nR.
